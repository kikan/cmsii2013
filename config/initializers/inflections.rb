# Add new inflection rules using the following format. Inflections
# are locale specific, and you may define rules for as many different
# locales as you wish. All of these examples are active by default:
ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
  inflect.plural /(\w+)ie$/i, '\1ies'
  inflect.singular /(\w+)ies/i, '\1ie'
#   inflect.irregular 'person', 'people'
#   inflect.uncountable %w( fish sheep )
end

# These inflection rules are supported but not enabled by default:
# ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
#   inflect.acronym 'RESTful'
# end
